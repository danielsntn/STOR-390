This homework is meant to illustrate the methods of classification algorithms as well as their potential pitfalls.  In class, we demonstrated K-Nearest-Neighbors using the `iris` dataset.  Today I will give you a different subset of this same data, and you will train a KNN classifier.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(class)

df <- data(iris) 

normal <-function(x) {
  (x -min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))   
}

iris_norm <- as.data.frame(lapply(iris[,c(1,2,3,4)], normal))

subset <- c(1:45, 58, 60:70, 82, 94, 110:150)
iris_train <- iris_norm[subset,] 
iris_test <- iris_norm[-subset,] 

iris_target_category <- iris[subset,5]
iris_test_category <- iris[-subset,5]

```

#
Above, I have given you a training-testing partition.  Train the KNN with $K = 5$ on the training data and use this to classify the 50 test observations.  Once you have classified the test observations, create a contingency table -- like we did in class -- to evaluate which observations your algorithm is misclassifying.   

```{r}
set.seed(123)
knn(iris_train, iris_test, cl = iris_target_category, k = 5)

pr <- knn(iris_train, iris_test, cl = iris_target_category, k=5)
tab <- table(pr, iris_test_category)
tab

accuracy <- function(x){
  sum(diag(x))/(sum(rowSums(x)))*100
}

accuracy(tab)
```

#

Discuss your results.  If you have done this correctly, you should have a classification error rate that is roughly 20% higher than what we observed in class.  Why is this the case? In particular run a summary of the `iris_test_category` as well as `iris_target_category` and discuss how this plays a role in your answer.  

*STUDENT INPUT* 
```{r}
summary(iris_test_category)
summary(iris_target_category)
```

This is the case because the test and target categories are 1) unrepresentative of the data and 2) they are very different from each other. If we look at the class example, the test and target categories are very similar representative of the data. This is because we didn't do a random subset of the data for the KNN.
